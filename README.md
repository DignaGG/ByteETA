# ByteETA - Professional Download Time Calculator

ByteETA is a tool designed to calculate file download durations based on various internet speeds. Originally started as a learning project, it is now being completely rebuilt using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Clean Code** practices.

## 🚀 Evolution of the Project
The initial versions of this project (v1.0 - v1.2) were developed with a procedural approach. To preserve the history of my development journey, those versions have been archived.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the original, procedural source code in the `legacy` branch.

## 🛠️ Current Goals (In Progress)
The project is currently undergoing a major refactor to implement:
- **OOP Architecture:** Separating concerns into Models, Services, and UI layers.
- **SOLID Principles:** Ensuring the code is modular, maintainable, and scalable.
- **Advanced Unit Conversion:** Precise byte-level calculations for Kbps, Mbps, Gbps and more.
- **Professional Git Workflow:** Utilizing feature branches and atomic commits.
