# ByteETA - Download Time Calculator

ByteETA v2.0 represents a complete architectural evolution. Transitioning from basic procedural scripts to a robust Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure, this version focuses on mathematical precision and system stability

##🚀 What's New in v2.0 (The OOP Era)
**Refactored Engine**: Implemented CalculatorService to separate business logic from the UI .
**Type-Safe Models**: Data is now handled through specialized FileInfo and InternetInfo classes.
**System Logic**: Explicit handling of base-1024 (Storage) vs. base-1000 (Network) units to ensure maximum accuracy.
**Dynamic Formatting**: Results are parsed through a custom formatter to produce human-readable time spans.

📸 v2.0 Stable Preview
Precise calculation for 1 GB at 100 Mbps resulting in 1 Minute 25 Seconds.

## 🚀 Evolution of the Project
The initial versions of this project (v1.0 - v1.2) were developed with a procedural approach. To preserve the history of my development journey, those versions have been archived.

> [!TIP]
> You can find the original, procedural source code in the `legacy` branch.
